# üëã Hello, I'm Kausshik Manojkumar!
## A little bit about me
I am a software developer passionate about all things in the field of technology. I love collaborating with other people who would love to make projects that, in turn, make a quantifiable change to tomorrow's society.

# üëÄ [What I am working on](https://github.com/KAUSSHIK?tab=repositories)
I am trying to diversify my knowledge in some fields, they include:
## Machine Learning
- Currently completing Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization (hosted by Stanford University Online & DeepLearning.ai)
- Trying to strengthen ML Fundamentals by taking appropriate coursework and building side projects such as the [Brain Tumor Classifier](https://github.com/KAUSSHIK/BrainTumorClassification)
- Expanding my knowledge on Federated Learning and trying to create a dashboard that helps users federate their ML models.
- Trying to learn MLOps through trial and error by deploying the Federated Learning Dashboard project.
- Currently trying to understand what Generative AI is.

## Web Development
- Currently focusing on the Backend Development side of Web Development by using JavaScript.
- Have worked on the Backend of Android Applications in the past, like [SwipeHire](https://github.com/KAUSSHIK/coms309)
- Trying to also experiment by deploying such projects on AWS, GCP, etc.
- Looking to start using OpenAI's APIs in my projects to improve their functionality.
